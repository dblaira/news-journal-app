```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### 2. Test V3 Features

#### Test Weekly Theme Generation
1. **Create 7+ entries** using the "+ New Entry" button
2. Look for the **"✨ Generate Weekly Theme"** button (appears when you have 7+ entries)
3. Click it and wait ~10-15 seconds for AI generation
4. Verify the **weekly theme banner** appears with headline and subtitle
5. Click **"View Full Analysis"** to see the full theme content
6. Click **"📄 Export PDF"** to download the weekly theme as PDF

#### Test Photo Upload
1. Click **"+ New Entry"**
2. Fill in headline, category, and content
3. Click **"Choose File"** under "Photo (optional)"
4. Select an image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP - max 10MB)
5. Verify the **preview appears** before submitting
6. Submit the entry
7. Verify the photo displays in:
   - Entry card
   - Hero section (if it's the latest entry)
   - Entry modal (when you click "Read")

#### Test PDF Export

2. Click **"📄 Export PDF"** button
3. Verify PDF downloads with:
   - Entry headline and content
   - AI-generated versions (if generated)

#### Test Nightly Generation (Optional)
The cron job runs automatically at 2 AM daily. To test manually:

```bash
# Get CRON_SECRET from .env.local, then:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron/generate-nightly \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

Or wait for it to run automatically at 2 AM.

### 3. Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy:

#### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete V3 implementation: weekly themes, photos, PDF export"
git push
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
- If already connected: Deployment happens automatically
- If not: Import repository in Vercel dashboard

#### Step 3: Add Environment Variables in Vercel
Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these (same values as `.env.local`):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional, for admin operations)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (your Vercel URL, e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

#### Step 4: Verify Cron Job
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Cron Jobs
- Should show `/api/cron/generate-nightly` scheduled for 2 AM daily
- Check logs after first run to verify it's working
