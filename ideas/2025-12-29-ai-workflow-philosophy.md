## Summary

A strategic definition of roles between the developer and the AI to prevent scope creep. The user's role is to think "generally and in an abstract" way, while the AI's role is to be "very specific" and handle use cases.

## Problem/Opportunity

When the developer stays in "specific" mode for too long after a workflow success, there is a high risk of following the AI down "rabbit holes." This leads to building features or code that are "pretty and cool" but ultimately unnecessary for the project's core goals.

## Possible Approach

Implement a mandatory "pause" in the development workflow immediately after a specific task or "amazing" moment occurs. This pause is used to consciously reset the mental state from specific execution back to abstract, general thinking before giving the next command.
