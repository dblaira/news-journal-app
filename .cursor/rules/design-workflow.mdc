# Design Workflow - Adam's Cognitive Profile

## The Core Insight

**Cognitive Profile:**
- Structural Visualization: 5th percentile — does not naturally see spatial relationships
- Analytical Reasoning: 13th percentile — sequential organization doesn't come naturally

**Strengths:**
- Pattern recognition
- Strategic "why" thinking
- Numerical reasoning
- Taste (knows it when he sees it)

## Your Job as an AI

**Translate spatial decisions into strategic questions.**

When Adam hits a design block:
- DON'T ask "what padding?" or "should this be 16px or 24px?"
- DO ask "what's most important here?" or "what should the user see first?"

He has taste but not spatial intuition. Help him use references and frameworks instead of trying to visualize.

# Design Decision Cheat Sheet

Keep this open while working in Cursor. When you hit a design block, use these frameworks instead of trying to visualize.

---

## The Core Principle

**You have taste. You don't have spatial intuition.**

Use your taste to curate references. Use these frameworks to make decisions. Let Cursor do the spatial translation.

---

## Framework 1: Hierarchy First

Before any layout decision, answer in order:

1. **What does the user need to see FIRST?** → Make it largest/top/most prominent
2. **What do they need SECOND?** → Make it supporting/smaller/below
3. **What's optional or advanced?** → Hide it, collapse it, or mute it

This is strategic, not spatial. You're good at this.

### Example: Context Builder
1. First: Summary line (the calibrated description) → Top, prominent, shaded background
2. Second: "What triggered this?" → Below summary, visible
3. Third: Selection chips → Collapsed by default, expandable

---

## Framework 2: Constraint Scales

Never freestyle. Pick from these fixed values:

### Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
```
4px   → Tight (between related items)
8px   → Compact (chip padding, small gaps)
12px  → Default small (list items)
16px  → Default medium (section padding)
24px  → Comfortable (card padding)
32px  → Roomy (section gaps)
48px  → Dramatic (major section breaks)
```

### Font Sizes
```
12px  → Fine print, metadata, timestamps
14px  → Body text, descriptions
16px  → Default UI text, buttons
18px  → Emphasized body, subheadings
24px  → Section headings
32px  → Page titles
48px  → Hero headlines
```

### Font Weight
```
400   → Normal (body text)
500   → Medium (subtle emphasis)
600   → Semibold (buttons, labels)
700   → Bold (headings, strong emphasis)
```

### Border Radius
```
4px   → Subtle softening (inputs, small buttons)
8px   → Standard rounded (cards, chips)
12px  → Friendly rounded (modals, large cards)
9999px → Pill shape (tags, badges)
```

### Opacity (for muting)
```
100%  → Full prominence
70%   → Slightly muted
50%   → Secondary info
30%   → Disabled/hint
```

### Z-Index
```
0     → Default
10    → Dropdowns, tooltips
20    → Sticky headers
30    → Modals, overlays
40    → Toasts, notifications
```

## Framework 3: The Feel → Reference → Constraints Pattern

When you can't decide, use this prompt template for Cursor:

```
I want [ELEMENT] to feel [ADJECTIVE].

Reference: [SCREENSHOT OR APP NAME]

Constraints:
- Spacing: use 8/16/24px scale
- Colors: [YOUR PALETTE or "match existing"]
- Match the visual weight of [REFERENCE]
```

### Feel Vocabulary
| If you want... | Say it feels... |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Easy to scan | Glanceable |
| Important | Prominent, bold |
| Secondary | Muted, subtle |
| Clickable | Tappable, interactive |
| Organized | Structured, grouped |
| Calm | Quiet, minimal |
| Energetic | Punchy, vibrant |
| Professional | Polished, clean |
| Friendly | Warm, approachable |

---

## Framework 4: Common Patterns (Pick, Don't Invent)

### Cards
- Padding: 16px or 24px
- Border-radius: 8px or 12px
- Background: slightly lighter/darker than page
- Shadow: subtle or none for dark mode

### Chips/Tags
- Padding: 4px 8px or 6px 12px
- Border-radius: 9999px (pill) or 6px (rounded)
- Font size: 12px or 14px
- Selected: filled background
- Unselected: outline or ghost

### Buttons
- Primary: filled, brand color, 600 weight text
- Secondary: outline or ghost, muted color
- Padding: 8px 16px (small) or 12px 24px (default)
- Border-radius: match your chips

### Input Fields
- Height: 40px or 44px
- Padding: 8px 12px
- Border: 1px solid muted
- Border-radius: 6px or 8px
- Focus: brand color border

### Section Spacing
- Between related items: 8px or 12px
- Between groups: 24px
- Between sections: 32px or 48px

## Framework 5: The "What's Wrong?" Diagnostic

When something looks off but you can't say why, run through this checklist:

| Symptom | Likely Fix |
|---------|------------|
| Feels cramped | Increase padding/margins by one scale step |
| Feels floaty | Decrease spacing, add borders or backgrounds |
| Can't find focus | Make one thing bigger, mute everything else |
| Looks chaotic | Align things, reduce variation |
| Feels cheap | Check font weights, add subtle shadows, refine spacing |
| Feels heavy | Reduce font weights, increase whitespace |
| Hard to read | Increase contrast, check font size |

## Quick Reference: App's Existing Palette

From style.css (Vanity Fair inspired):

```
Background:      #1A1A1A (dark), #FDFCFA (light)
Surface:         #27272A (dark panels)
Text primary:    #FFFFFF (dark), #1A1A1A (light)
Text muted:      rgba(255,255,255,0.5) or #6B7280
Brand/accent:    #DC143C (Crimson Red)
Success:         #22C55E
Warning:         #F59E0B
Error:           #EF4444
Cream highlight: #F5F0E8
```

## Emergency Prompt Templates

### "I don't know what spacing to use"
```
Make the spacing feel balanced. Use 8px for tight groupings, 
16px for standard padding, 24px between distinct sections. 
Show me the result.
```

### "I don't know if this should be above or below"
```
The user needs to see [X] first, then [Y]. 
Arrange them in that priority order.
```

### "This looks wrong but I don't know why"
```
Something feels off about [ELEMENT]. Compare it to [REFERENCE APP]. 
What's different? Fix it to match that feel.
```

### "I can't decide between two options"
```
Show me both versions side by side:
Option A: [description]
Option B: [description]
I'll pick based on what I see.
```

## The Meta-Rule

**When stuck for more than 2 minutes on a design decision:**

1. Find a reference (screenshot something that works)
2. Point Cursor at it
3. Say "match this feel"
4. Move on

Your time is worth more than pixel-perfect decisions. Ship it, then refine based on how it feels in use.
